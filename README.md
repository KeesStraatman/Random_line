# Random line

This macro will create random lines using the whole image or a user defined ROI. In Version 2 the user can set the number of lines required and store them in the ROI Manager. The randomization has been optimized using the macro code from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/examples/RandomizeArray.txt but further optimized with a time factor.
# Run macro
To run the macro a single time create a results table and via Plugins > Macros > Run... select the macro. Alternatively install it via Plugins > Macros > Install ... and the macro will be added to the Plugins > Macros menu, till you restart ImageJ/Fiji.

# Disclaimer
All the macros published on this repository can be used at your own risk. Although I did my best to ensure that they run as intended, there may be bugs, not expected use or changes to the ImageJ code that results in unexpected behaviour. If you notice a problem with any of the macros please let me know and I will try to solve the problem.
