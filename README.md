# Random line

This macro will create random lines using the whole image or a user defined ROI. In Version 2 the user can set the number of lines required and store them in the ROI Manager. The randomization has been optimized using the macro code from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/examples/RandomizeArray.txt but further optimized with a time factor.
